# About

This Python package facilitates the browsing of the indices of the old TLG CD-ROMs. It expects that texts have been processed by the `tlgu` package ([tlgu homepage](https://tlgu.carmen.gr/), [rehosted code](https://github.com/cltk/grc_software_tlgu)), which offers a variety of ways to convert the Beta Code of the original files into Unicode text files.

# Disclaimer

This repository makes no claim to ownership of the contents of the original TLG CD-ROM, which are owned by the University of California, Irvine. This project is an independent effort to facilitate browsing and study of texts and does not represent or imply endorsement by the University of California, Irvine or the TLG project.
